# Probability density function (pdf) estimate of a randomly generated dataset of 100 data points (represented by a 100 dimensional vector): a functions which estimate the probability density

a function (pdf) of a given dataset of 100 data points (represented by a 100 dimensional
vector). For representing the (continuous) pdf in discrete form in Python, linearly
spaced vector created
